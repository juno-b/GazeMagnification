Project Summary
This project was completed during the summer 2022 REU in Computational Sensing at Rochester Institute of Technology. The PI for the project was Kristen Shinohara. The co-leads of the program were Reynold Bailey and Cecilia Alm. We also worked closely with a PhD student, Rajesh Titung, and one of the other PIs, Jamison Heard. I was the primary contributor to this project but worked with another undergraduate student, Kwame Andre, throughout the process.

This project consisted of designing a website to test the efficacy of eye tracking software on low vision individuals. It consisted of two activities, a word search and the circle click game. My work primarily focused on the word search activity, but I contributed to both projects. In this document, I list the web link to see a functional version of the code and a Github link. This folder also contains a Jupyter notebook of data analysis for the project as well as the final paper.

*Note: in order to complete any of the activities, you must calibrate the eye tracking! Upon completion, the site will attempt to download the data from the activity in a small file. The site also uses cookies to save the magnification settings. On occasion, the magnifier window may stop working, a simple page refresh will resolve this issue.

The magnifier test allows participants to change the size of the magnification window using the arrow keys or WASD keys. The level of magnification can also be adjusted with Z and CTRL+Z.
Test 1 is the word search baseline/ control activity.
Test 2 is the circle game baseline/ control activity.
*After completing these tests, the experimenters determined if the eye tracking was working effectively. If it was, they would complete the “B” track with gaze-enabled controls. If not, they would complete the “A” track with the same controls as the baseline.
Test 3A/3B are the word search and contain the same activities, but 3B enables gaze controls.
Test 4A/4B are the circle game and contain the same activities, but 4B enables gaze controls.

Javascript Code
I have attached the entire code for this project. The github link is here: https://github.com/jxbreu22/public_html The best representation of my work can be found at Code/js/ in the following files: gazeMagStudy_1.js, gazeMagStudy2.js, and gazeMouse.js
